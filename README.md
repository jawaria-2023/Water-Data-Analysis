# Water-Data-Analysis
Here is a complete R script for analyzing the water analysis data. This script includes importing the data, performing descriptive statistics, ANOVA, normality checks, PCA, regression analysis, hierarchical clustering, and generating various plots:

This script assumes that your data has been cleaned and preprocessed where necessary. Replace "/path/to/WATER ANALYSIS.xlsx" with the actual path to the water data file. Before running PCA and clustering, ensure your data is appropriately formatted and cleaned. If your dataset contains non-numeric or categorical variables that you want to include in the PCA, you'll need to preprocess these variables accordingly.
